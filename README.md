Fractile
===========

This program uses SDL to generate custom fractals in a simple and (hopefully) lightweight manor. 

If you would like to try using this program, open the

	bin/Release History/
	
directory and choose the most recent version.

Otherwise, if you want to compile this program yourself, use these linker settings in Code::Blocks:

-lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lwinmm -lSDL2_image

Make sure you have your include and lib directories set up right in Code::Blocks.
 
See http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/index.php for tutorials on SDL compilation.
