wobble boxes get shifted when they are cut off by the bottom of the window!
Thanks, JP.





when you switch to a new fractal, the scale of the vectors in the editor window is not properly adjusted.
I also need to add options to enter in values numerically
Thanks, Corbin.


Corbin suggested a feature that locks vectors in equal magnitude but opposite direction.
I think this is a great idea, but I'll do it one better:
have the ability to specify a vector based on a different vector in general.
have the ability to "reference" a vector to another vector.
Be able to change this reference manually.
The reference variables will be comprised two variables:
1. a scaling factor (that describes what percentage of the original vector this new vector will be
2. a twist (shown to the user in degrees, stored in memory as radians) that describes the angle from the referenced vector to the current one.




The window does not currently auto-fit the fractal properly.
What I need to do is calculate:
	xmax, xmin, ymax, ymin
for every iteration of the fractal. (This takes in to account the twisting of each iteration)
It seems logical to simply sum them up after that, but that is not quite right.
what you need to do is this:
	
	// at this point, the xmax[], xmin[], ymax[], and ymin[] terms have been calculated at each iteration.
	
	double xmaxglobal = xmax[0]	// this is the xmax at iteration 0
	double xminglobal = xmin[0]	// this is the xmin at iteration 0
	double ymaxglobal = ymax[0]	// this is the ymax at iteration 0
	double yminglobal = ymin[0]	// this is the ymin at iteration 0
	
	for(i=0; i<iterations; i++){
		if(xmaxglobal + xmax[i] > xmaxglobal){	// calculate the right-most any line will ever be.
			xmaxglobal += xmax[i];
		}
		if(xminglobal + xmin[i] < xminglobal){	// calculate the left-most any line will ever be.
			xminglobal += xmin[i];
		}
		if(ymaxglobal + ymax[i] > ymaxglobal){	// calculate the lowest any line will ever be.
			ymaxglobal += ymax[i];
		}
		if(yminglobal + ymin[i] < yminglobal){	// calculate the highest any line will ever be.
			yminglobal += ymin[i];
		}
	}



I need to add an opiton for a secondary color.
The color should shift from one to another as you move from the first iteration onwards.
 

you should be able to specify which iterations are displayed. (i.e. boxes with check marks for each iteration)


I need an editor window for adjusting just the entry and exit points of the fractal. blue = entry, red = exit.


make a scroll bar for the space in which you reserved a scroll bar (for vectors and exit points)


add a button to increase/decrease the number of vectors (maybe up/down)
add a similar button to increase/decrease the number of exit points (maybe left/right)


add an option to lock exit points to their vectors. This will be a toggle feature.
locked exit points will appear yellow.
unlocked exit points will appear red.
the entry point of the vector will be blue.
