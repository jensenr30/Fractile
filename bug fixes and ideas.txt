wobble boxes get shifted when they are cut off by the bottom of the window!
Thanks, JP.





when you switch to a new fractal, the scale of the vectors in the editor window is not properly adjusted.
I also need to add options to enter in values numerically
Thanks, Corbin.





The window does not currently auto-fit the fractal properly.
What I need to do is calculate:
	xmax, xmin, ymax, ymin
for every iteration of the fractal. (This takes in to account the twisting of each iteration)
It seems logical to simply sum them up after that, but that is not quite right.
what you need to do is this:
	
	// at this point, the xmax[], xmin[], ymax[], and ymin[] terms have been calculated at each iteration.
	
	double xmaxglobal = xmax[0]	// this is the xmax at iteration 0
	double xminglobal = xmin[0]	// this is the xmin at iteration 0
	double ymaxglobal = ymax[0]	// this is the ymax at iteration 0
	double yminglobal = ymin[0]	// this is the ymin at iteration 0
	
	for(i=0; i<iterations; i++){
		if(xmaxglobal + xmax[i] > xmaxglobal){	// calculate the right-most any line will ever be.
			xmaxglobal += xmax[i];
		}
		if(xminglobal + xmin[i] < xminglobal){	// calculate the left-most any line will ever be.
			xminglobal += xmin[i];
		}
		if(ymaxglobal + ymax[i] > ymaxglobal){	// calculate the lowest any line will ever be.
			ymaxglobal += ymax[i];
		}
		if(yminglobal + ymin[i] < yminglobal){	// calculate the highest any line will ever be.
			yminglobal += ymin[i];
		}
	}
